1. Go to github.com with your favorite web browser and search for “ruby”.
2. Pick a random project and click on it.
3. Click on the Source tab and browse through the list of files and directories until you find a .rb file.
4. Start at the top and read through it, taking notes on what you think it does.
5. If any symbols or strange words seem to interest you, write them down to research later.

Now try several other sites:
• heroku.com
• rubygems.org
